# Data pipeline

Everything in PyOps starts from the game itself. PyOps runs Factorio headlessly to
dump its fully-resolved prototype data, then imports it into SQLite. This is
orchestrated end-to-end from **Settings › Game data** in the UI
(`app/src/server/dump.ts`):

1. **Write a helper mod** (`pyops-dump`) into your Factorio mods folder and enable
   it. It sets `data.data_crawler = "yafc pyops"`, which makes `pypostprocessing`
   run its planner integration — TURD sub-techs become real technologies, farm
   recipes get representable fluids, etc. A `data-final-fixes.lua` then patches up
   anything that integration leaves engine-invalid (1.x-style recipe results,
   missing icons, broken TURD unlock effects) and exports the TURD
   recipe-replacement map as mod-data.
2. **Dump** via `factorio --dump-data`, `--dump-prototype-locale`, and optionally
   `--dump-icon-sprites`. (Icons load the _full_ game/renderer and are slow, so
   they're opt-in; data + locale dump in seconds.)
3. **Disable the helper mod again** — it must never be active during normal play.
4. **Import** the dump into SQLite (`app/src/db/import-factorio.ts`), then
   synthesize the recipes the engine doesn't model as recipes: mining, boiling,
   burning, spoiling, and per-temperature fluid variants
   (`app/src/db/synthesize.ts`).
5. **Rebuild the icon atlas** (`buildIconAtlas`, `app/src/server/icon-atlas.ts`):
   pack the dumped sprites into content-hash-deduped 4096² sheets + a
   `(type, name) → slot` manifest, written to the data dir's `icon-data/`. The app
   serves them at `/icons/*` (`app/src/routes/icons.$.ts`), cached `immutable` and
   cache-busted by the data fingerprint in the sheet URLs (`?v=…`).
6. **Compute cost analysis** — a YAFC-style LP that assigns each good an intrinsic
   cost (`app/src/server/cost-analysis.ts`, a port of YAFC's `CostAnalysis.cs`).
7. **Apply mod migrations** — read each enabled mod's `migrations/*.json` and
   auto-apply any newly-present prototype renames to saved blocks
   (`app/src/server/migrations.ts`; see drift resilience below).

The enabled mod set is fingerprinted (a hash of mod names) and stamped into the DB,
so the planner knows which version of the game its data reflects. The full mod list
is persisted alongside it (`mod_list` in `meta`): each mod's name, **version**, and
enabled state (`readMods`, `app/src/server/dump.ts` — `mod-list.json` carries only
name + enabled, so versions are recovered from the `name_x.y.z.zip` entries in the
mods directory). This records the provenance of the reference data — shown on the
Settings → Game data tab — and gives drift detection and rename capture
a concrete previous state to diff against, not just a hash.

**Drift detection** (`modDriftFn`, `diffMods`/`redumpNeeded` in `dump.ts`) compares
the game's _current_ mod set against that persisted baseline, by name **and**
version, and categorizes the change (added / removed / enabled / disabled /
version-changed). `needsRedump` is true only when the _enabled_ mods or their
versions changed (disabled-mod churn doesn't affect the data). When drift is
detected a **guided modal** (`DriftModal`, opened via the shared `drift-store`)
pops with the categorized changes and an ignore/re-sync choice, then walks the dump
as a step-by-step progress flow (`lib/sync-steps.ts` maps each `SyncPhase` to a
labelled step) ending in a summary that links to the Factory block change-report. It
re-checks on app start, on project switch (a full reload), on bridge reconnect
(Factorio likely restarted), and every couple of hours; an ignored drift leaves a
small "data stale" chip in the nav to re-open the modal, and Settings → Game data
shows the same detail. Reading the mod set is cheap (two small file reads), so
checking often costs little.

Saved blocks additionally carry a **per-block reference fingerprint**
(`blockReferenceFingerprint`, `app/src/db/queries.ts`): a hash over the _current_
definitions of just the recipes and goal goods that block references. Unlike the
global mod-name hash, it changes when a referenced recipe is altered in place (an
in-place mod update) or disappears, so staleness registers for exactly the blocks
that are affected. When a block references a recipe or goal good that no longer
exists, `computeBlock` refuses to solve it — solving the surviving subset would
silently produce wrong rates — and instead returns `broken` with the missing
references. The block's input doc and its last-good cached I/O are preserved
untouched (so re-enabling the mod or re-importing restores it), the block view and
sidebar flag it, and `recomputeAllBlocks` skips overwriting its cache.

**Pure renames are auto-applied during the dump** (`migrations.ts`), so this broken
fallback is reserved for references that genuinely changed meaning or disappeared.
Mods ship declarative `migrations/*.json` files (`{ "recipe": [["old","new"], …],
"item"/"fluid"/"entity": … }`) inside their zips; a mod's own Lua runtime can't read
other mods' migration files, but the backend reads them straight from the zips (via
`fflate`) or unpacked folders. Each dump records which migration files it has seen
(`migrations_applied` in `meta`, keyed by `mod/file`); a file newly present since the
last dump is a new rename, applied across every saved block's references — the
`goals`, `recipes`, the recipe-keyed `machines`/`fuels`/`modules`/`beacons` and
their member names, disposition keys, and `iconName`. The **first** run after this
ships only records the baseline and applies nothing (existing blocks already
reference current names), so renames fire only on a genuine future mod update. The
`.lua` migration files are procedural save-state scripts, not renames, and are
skipped.

## Why a helper mod

`pypostprocessing` already ships a YAFC/planner integration, but it triggers only
when a crawler marker is present and was written against YAFC's lenient Lua crawler
rather than the real engine validator. The `pyops-dump` helper supplies that marker
and then repairs the fallout so a real `--dump-data` run succeeds: it normalizes
1.x-style `result =` recipes, fills in missing icons and fluid-box volumes, drops
recipes whose result item never got created (and scrubs the now-dangling
`unlock-recipe` tech effects), and rebuilds TURD sub-tech unlock effects that the
integration leaves empty. It's strictly a dump-time tool — `dump.ts` enables it,
runs the dumps, and disables it again in a `finally` block so it never lingers for
normal play.

## Data model notes

The schema (`app/src/db/schema.ts`) models Factorio reference data plus PyOps'
own planning state (blocks, groups, TURD selections, cost analysis, meta). A few
deliberate choices:

- **Quality is not modelled** — Py has none.
- **Fluid temperatures are** — ingredients carry a min/max range, products an exact
  temperature; the synthetic-recipe pass generates per-temperature variants.
- **Energy is pseudo-fluids** — `pyops-electricity` and `pyops-heat` flow through
  the model as goods (1 unit = 1 MJ) so a reactor recipe gets sized to a block's
  heat draw, but they're filtered out of normal import/byproduct lists and surfaced
  separately as power/heat in watts.
- **Logistics prototypes** — `belts`, `loaders`, and `inserters` tables capture the
  bits needed to size belt/inserter counts per block row (the **Logistics** display,
  issue #21): belt/loader `speed`, and per-inserter `rotation_speed` /
  `extension_speed` / pickup+drop vectors / `bulk` / `max_belt_stack_size`. Stacking
  research lives in `tech_stack_bonuses` (one row per tech per effect:
  `belt-stack-size-bonus`, `inserter-stack-size-bonus`, `bulk-inserter-capacity-bonus`),
  summed over the in-effect tech set (`queries.stackBonuses`, following the research
  horizon) to derive the current belt placed-stack and inserter hand stack. The
  throughput math is a pure module (`app/src/lib/logistics.ts`) — belts are
  `speed × 480 × stack`; inserters use the swing model ported from the in-game
  `inserter-throughput-lib` (inventory→inventory case). The per-row arithmetic runs
  client-side so changing belt/inserter tier is instant (no re-solve).
- **Rocket logistics** (issue #22) — `items.weight` (rocket-lift weight) feeds an
  optional launches/min readout: `floor(rocket_lift_weight / weight)` per rocket,
  then `rate × 60 / capacity`. `rocket_lift_weight` and `default_item_weight` come
  from `utility-constants.default` (stashed in `meta` at import). Only ~15% of items
  set an explicit `weight`; the rest are runtime-derived from recipes, which Py's
  cyclic graph makes impractical to recompute, so unset items fall back to
  `default_item_weight` (flagged in the tooltip as an estimate).
